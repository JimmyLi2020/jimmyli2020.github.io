			Using his interest in video games as a motivation, Jimmy dove right into the field of Computer Science as he discovers a coding class in Avon Old Farms School, a high school in Avon, Connecticut which he attended. He first joined the summer course and developed his own version of a brick breaker game, then worked on two other projects during the school year. After he finished AP Computer Science A, Jimmy continued his studies in the field of computer science in a research project back in China. In this CIS research project, Jimmy worked along another partner and developed a program analysis which examined whether a code file contained potential loops that may cause infinite recursion, in turn cause a stack overflow error (Java). Along with the end of the summer and this project, Jimmy moved to even higher level coding in the Advanced Topics in Computer Science course, in which he learned to work with different data structures as well as the introductory skills to developing an mobile app and a webpage. In the fall of 2020, Jimmy will be a freshman in the University of Wisconsin, Madison, majoring in Computer Science.
